# my_crypto_library
Started out as Cryptopal challengs, but now I'm making it a cryptography library.

This is purely for learning purposes and should not be used in any software as they are not thoroughly tested for security
and I am quite sure there are a lot of vulnerabilities in it.

Breaking these crypto codes is one of the goals :)
